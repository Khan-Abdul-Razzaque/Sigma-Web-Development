The Cascade Algorithm

CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheets. The cascade is the algorithm for solving conflict where multiple CSS rules apply to an HTML element. It's the reason thatthe text of the button styled with the above CSS will be purple.

Understanding the cascading algorithm helps you understand how the browser resolve conflict like this. The cascade algorithm has 4 distinct stages.
    1. Position and order of appearance:
        the order in which your CSS rules appear.
        
    2. Specificity:
        on algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match.
        
    3. Origin:
        the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whehter that is a browser style, CSS form a browser extension, or your othered CSS.
        
    4. Importance:
        some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others,  especially with the !important rule type.
